# Dell-Latitude-3190-Hackintosh
I've managed to get OpenCore and Hackintosh working on the Dell Latitude 3190 2-in-1 Laptop
Please note that if there are some glitches, bugs, or anything. Please report them to me.
Any files or the config.plist may subject to change in the future.
The system if booted into macOS will be recognised as a MacBookAir7,1
The maximum macOS it can support is macOS 12 Monterey, if possible, you can try macOS 26 Tahoe
Follow the Dortania's OpenCore guide in order to download the macOS Recovery files (you'll need Python installed on your computer)
For the tech savvys out there, i've also included a "Reset NVRAM" entry in the OpenCore boot menu for advnced diagnosis.
If you try newer macOSes, you wont be able to properly use the operating system
TRY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.. I recommend using an external SSD to easily get back into your current OS
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL OPENCORE EFI PREBUILD. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH OPENCORE OR HACKINTOSH...
